# keras-mnist
Working on the MNIST dataset, going for 100%. Models implemented with Keras.io

The MNIST dataset is the "Hello, World" of machine learning.

- A basic classifier can get it to 92% test/validation accuracy
- A [3-layer network](https://github.com/stephenjfox/keras-mnist/blob/master/Keras%20Basics.ipynb) can get 95%, in less than a minute of testing
- And so much more!!!


## Purpose

There is probably a network online that has 100% testing validation that I could just read and copy.

- Say I "learned the code by example".

*But that's not what this repo is for*. There is truly something to be said for "discovering it on your own"

- Yes, it takes longer.
- But then you have it. And know for truth.

So I am going to do use this repository as a:

1. Testing ground for deep neural network architecture ideas that I come across in my research
2. Means of teaching myself Keras with nothing but [the](https://keras.io/activations/) [__fantastic__](https://keras.io/) [documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/).
